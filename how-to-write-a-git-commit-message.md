# Rules

The most **!important** rule is to write messages in English. We work (or may work) in international environment 
therefore every team member should be able to understand what's going on in the project.

## The seven rules of a great Git commit message

1. Separate subject from body with a blank line
2. Limit the subject line to 50 characters
3. Capitalize the subject line
4. Do not end the subject line with a period
5. Use the imperative mood in the subject line
6. Wrap the body at 72 characters
7. Use the body to explain what and why vs. how

That's all you need to know!
